        E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment that's been discarded. This includes working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or donated to a charity reseller like Goodwill. Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be thrown away. E-waste is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when buried. With the spread of urbanisation and the readily available modern conveniences, civic authorities in the city are faced with a growing problem of electronic waste management. Many residents continue to dispose of, among other things, broken or outmoded computers, televisions, vehicles batteries and insulated wires, along with the regular domestic waste, say environmentalists.<br><br>

        As global population growth rises, consumption of households will increase. Consequently, the amount of waste they generate rises globally. In addition, Hoonrweg and Bhada-Tata (2012) point out that economic development is one of the factors that contribute to the rate of waste produced, besides the scale of industrialization publ ic habits and local climate. Higher economic development in a country (which is shown by an increase in economic growth) means the income level of households increases, and this is highly correlated to consumption. The consumption of goods and services consequently increases, as does the amount of waste produced.<br><br>

        <b>But we can definitely bring this under control. There are numerous ways to recycle e-waste, a few of them being noted as:</b><br><br>

        Using "the cloud" involves storing and managing data on a network of servers maintained on the internet by a third party. Cloud computing can help businesses proactively reduce e-waste by lessening the demand on hard drives, so devices will last longerâ€”reducing the need to purchase, repair, or replace hardware as often.<br><br>

        ALIGN E-WASTE RECYCLING WITH YOUR COMPANY CULTURE:<br> Whether it's the time that goes into finding a solution for old electronics or the lack of understanding as to which are valuable, reusable, or recyclable, enthusiasm for outgoing e-waste can be low. However, through building excitement and educational resources around recvclina e-waste, businesses may give them a second life at local schools, non-profits, underserved populations, or community groups. Donations can help provide access to a world of knowledge and social connection that will make a huge impact, both on the planet and on the empowered individuals who inherit your electronics.<br><br>
